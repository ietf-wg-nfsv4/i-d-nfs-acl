--- abstract

This Informational document describes the NFS_ACL protocol.
NFS_ACL is a legacy member of the Network File System family
of protocols that NFS clients use to view and update Access
Control Lists stored on an NFS version 2 or version 3 server.

# Introduction

The Network File System protocol (NFS) was introduced by Sun
Microsystems in the 1980s. This protocol enabled applications
to access and modify files, via local POSIX system interfaces,
that reside on a remote host {{RFC1094}}.

Traditionally, permission to access files stored in NFS file
systems is granted by permission bits, mimicking {{POSIX}}.
Permission bits provide coarse-grained access control. The
file owner can control only whether members of her group can
read, write, or execute the file contents, or whether anyone
else (without exception) has those rights.

An Access Control List, or ACL, is a mechanism that enables
file owners to grant specific users fine-grained access
rights to file content {{IEEE}}.

Version 2 of NFS is described in {{RFC1094}}, and version 3
in {{RFC1813}}. Neither of these protocols include a method
for managing ACLs associated with files shared via the NFS
protocol, even though the local file systems shared via NFS
often implemented ACLs and gave local users mechanisms to
read and update them.

Sun created the NFS_ACL protocol to provide that mechanism
for files accessed remotely via NFS. Later, other operating
systems, including Linux, implemented NFS_ACL for similar
reasons.

This document describes the protocol based on the nfs_acl.x
file that is publicly available in the OpenSolaris
code base {{OpenSolaris}}. The editor has attempted to
introduce no changes to the protocol as it is implemented
in those operating systems and in Linux.

The document assumes readers are already familiar with the
NFS version 2 or 3 protocols and at least one implementation
of them.

Issues of compatibility between the protocol described in
this document and NFSv4 ACLs (as described by {{RFC8881}})
are considered out of scope. More information on this topic
is available in {{?I-D.ietf-nfsv4-posix-acls}}.

Local file systems on NFSv2 and NFSv3 servers determine the
particular semantics of each Access Control List -- in other
words, how the server uses each Access Control List to
authorize access to file content. This document serves only
as a description of the network protocol used to exchange
ACLs between NFS clients and servers.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

As with most publications by standards bodies, this document
has been published so that people may continue to create
compatible implementations. However, note that, as an
Informational document, this RFC does not make any compliance
mandates on implementations of the protocol described herein.

# General Concepts

## A Glossary of Useful Terms

The following are a set of foundational terms used throughout
this document.

application:
: A program that executes on a client system.

client:
: A computer system that utilizes compute resources provided by one or
more servers.

file:
: A unit of data storage consisting of an ordered stream of
bytes and a set of metadata attributes.

gid:
: A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents a group of users.

server:
: A computer system that provides compute resources to network peers.

uid:
: A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents a specific user.

user:
: A person logged in on a client system.

## Remote Procedure Call

The Sun Remote Procedure Call (SunRPC) protocol provides a
procedure-oriented interface to remote services. Each server
supplies a program, which is a set of procedures. The NFS
service is one such program. The combination of host address,
program number, version number, and procedure number specify one
remote service procedure.  Servers can support multiple versions
of a program that are accessed using different protocol version
numbers.

The NFS and NFS_ACL protocols are both based on SunRPC. The
remainder of this document assumes an NFS environment that is
implemented on top of SunRPC, as it is specified in {{RFC5531}}.

## External Data Representation

The eXternal Data Representation (XDR) specification provides a
standard way of representing a set of data types on a network.
XDR addresses the problem of communication between network
peers with different byte orders, structure alignment, and data
type representation.

This document utilizes the RPC Data Description Language to
specify the XDR format arguments and results to each of the RPC
service procedures that an NFS_ACL server provides.

Readers can find a full guide to XDR and the RPC Data Description
Language in {{RFC4506}}.

### XDR Types Not Defined in RFC 4506

The original NFS_ACL RPC language specification uses the "unsigned short" and
"unsigned long" types. {{RFC4506}} describes neither, though most current
implementations of the rpcgen program accept both. This section describes the
"unsigned short" and "unsigned long" integer types as used in this document,
based on those implementations, so that the NFS_ACL RPC language specification
appearing here accurately reflects the wire behavior of existing
implementations. It does not add these types to the RPC Data Description
Language.

The XDR wire representation of each of these types is a network-endian 32-bit
integer. This maintains XDR's consistent 4-octet alignment for all basic
integer types while allowing applications to use narrower types internally.
The subsections below describe how a value of each type occupies that 32-bit
field.

#### unsigned short

The unsigned short type is zero-extended, with the high-order two octets each
containing zeroes on the wire. The value range of this type is zero to 65,535,
inclusive.

Example: 0xFFFF (65535) appears as 0x0000FFFF on the wire.

#### unsigned long

The unsigned long type occupies all four octets of the 32-bit field and
requires no extension. Its wire representation is identical to that of the
"unsigned int" type described in {{Section 4.2 of RFC4506}}. The value range
of this type is zero to 4,294,967,295, inclusive.

The NFS version 3 protocol specification {{RFC1813}} uses this type name for
32-bit unsigned quantities, and this document retains it in the data types
that it inherits from that protocol.

## Authentication and Authorization {#auth-and-authz}

The RPC protocol includes fields in every procedure call for
user authentication parameters. The specific content of the
authentication parameters is determined by the type of
authentication used by the server and client. A discussion
of the mechanics of RPC user authentication appears in
{{RFC5531}}, in particular Sections 9 and 10.

For NFS ACLs, the user ID carried in RPC calls is used
for two purposes:

* When setting an ACL via the SETACL procedure, the NFS_ACL
service verifies that the calling user has been granted
permission to perform the procedure. The GETACL procedure
carries no such check of its own. The server passes the
calling user's credential to the local file system, which
may or may not restrict who can read an object's ACL.

* Each Access Control Entry (see below) contains an element
that identifies the user to which the ACE applies. That
user is represented by a 32-bit user ID. The value of the
user ID in each ACE has the same meaning and mapping as
the value of incoming RPC calls.

Using user ids and group ids implies that the client and
server either share the same ID list or do local user and
group ID mapping. Servers and clients must agree on the
mapping from user to uid and from group to gid, for those
sites that do not implement a consistent user ID and group
ID number space. In practice, such mapping is typically
performed on the server, following a static mapping scheme
or a mapping established by the user from a client at
mount time.

RPCSEC_GSS authentication provides stronger
security through the use of cryptographic authentication.
The server and client must agree on the mapping of the
user's GSS principal to a local UID on the server, but
the name to identity mapping is more operating system
independent than the uid and gid mapping in AUTH_UNIX.

## File Access Control

This section describes the abstractions that an NFS server
uses to determine whether an access or modification
to a file is permitted. The exact behavior of a server
implementation may vary.

### File Ownership

A file’s "owner" is the designated user that is always granted
permission to update that file’s security attributes. As part of
creating a file, the NFS server assigns the file’s owner. Under
normal circumstances the initial file owner is the RPC user who
issued the NFS CREATE procedure. However, server security policies
can mandate replacement of that user (also known as user squashing)
as part of processing a CREATE procedure.

An existing file’s designated owner can subsequently be changed by
an NFS SETATTR procedure. After that change, the new owner is
granted permission to update the file’s security attributes and
the old owner is no longer treated specially.

A file’s "owner group" is a short list of users that have
similar privileges as the file’s owner, but are treated as a
separate category for the purpose of permission checking.

Any user who is not a file's owner or a member of its owner
group falls into the third category, known as "everyone" or
"other".

#### Superuser Access

On most operating systems, there is a category of users known as
privileged users or superusers. These users can bypass most or
all access controls on files.

### Categories of Access

In NFS versions 2 and 3, there are three rudimentary categories
of access:

Read access:
: Read access grants permission for a user to read a file or
directory.

Write access:
: Write access grants permission for a user to modify a file
or directory.

Execute access:
: For a file, execute access grants permission for the user to
treat the file content as executable. For a directory object,
execute access grants permission for the user to perform a
lookup in that directory.

### Traditional Permission Bits

Permission bits, or mode bits, are the simplest and perhaps
oldest form of access control. Each file object has a set
of mode bits {{POSIX}}.

Each of the user categories is given a set of three access
type bits. Altogether there are then nine bit flags for
every file object.

### Access Control Lists

An Access Control Entry, or ACE, represents a set of access categories
and a specific user or group. An Access Control List is a list of ACEs.

Mode bits, as explained in the previous section, are essentially an
ACL that always contains exactly three ACEs: one for the file's owner,
one for the file's owner group, and one for everyone else.

#### Interpreting Access Control Lists {#interpreting-acls}

NFS clients do not perform access checks based on their
interpretation of an ACL read from the server. NFS servers
are solely responsible for authorizing and restricting
access to file content via the NFS protocol.

An NFS Access Control List is a list of three or more
Access Control Entries (ACEs) associated with one file
system object. Each Access Control Entry in this list
specifies a user and a set of access types granted to
that user.

Only ACEs that match the requester are considered. Each
ACE is processed until all of the bits of the requester's
access have been ALLOWED. Once a bit has been ALLOWED,
that bit is no longer considered in the processing
of subsequent ACEs in the list.

When the ACL has been fully processed, if there are bits
in the requester's mask that have not been ALLOWED,
access of that type is denied.

Note that an ACL might not be the sole determiner of access. For example:

- In the case of a file system exported as read-only,
the server may deny write access even though an object's
ACL grants it.
- Server implementations can grant some limited permission
to update an ACL in order to prevent a situation from
rising in which there is no valid way to ever modify the ACL.
- All servers will allow a user the ability to read the
data of the file when only the execute permission is granted
(i.e., if the ACL denies the user the NA_READ access and
allows the user NA_EXEC, the server will allow the user to
read the data of the file).
- Some server implementations have the notion of
owner-override, in which the owner of the object is allowed
to override accesses that are denied by the ACL. This can be
helpful, for example, to allow users continued access to
open files on which the permissions have changed.
- Some server implementations have the notion of a
"superuser" that has privileges beyond an ordinary user.
The superuser may be able to read or write data or metadata
in ways that would otherwise not be permitted by the object's
ACL.

NFS clients can use either the NFS_ACL version 2 ACCESS
procedure or the NFS version 3 ACCESS procedure to ask the
server to perform an access check based on the requesting
user and the ACL present on a file system object. Clients are
also free to simply try an operation to see what works, then
recover it the server denies access.

#### ACLs in Operation {#acls-in-operation}

The SETACL procedure sets two types of Access Control Lists:

Access:
: An NFS access ACL specifies the access permission
for a file object. Access Control Entries in an ACL's
"aclent" field comprise the object's access ACL.

Default:
: An NFS default ACL specifies the default ACL that
is set on objects that are children of a directory.
Access Control Entries in an ACL's "dfaclent" comprise
an object's default ACL. The default ACL does not affect
access to the object on which it is set.

Each NFS ACL must have one ACE for each of
NA_USER_OBJ, NA_GROUP_OBJ, and NA_OTHER_OBJ.
An NFS ACL that consists only of these
three ACEs is referred to as a minimal NFS ACL.

An NFS ACL may have zero or more NA_USER and/or NA_GROUP
ACEs.

On the wire, a minimal NFS ACL is represented as either
three Access Control Entries or four. A sender that uses
four adds an NA_CLASS_OBJ entry to the NA_USER_OBJ,
NA_GROUP_OBJ, and NA_OTHER_OBJ entries, and derives that
entry's "perm" element from the permission bits of the
object's owning group. The Linux NFS server expands a
three-entry list this way in both the "aclent" and the
"dfaclent" array.

The Solaris NFS_ACL server performs no such expansion, and
what it sends depends on the file system it exports. A
Solaris server exporting a ZFS file system sends the
manufactured ACL described in {{no-acl-support}}, which
always occupies four entries in the "aclent" array and none
in the "dfaclent" array. A Solaris server exporting a UFS
file system sends three entries for an object whose ACL has
no mask entry. A receiver accepts either representation in
either array.

The Access Control Entries in each of the "aclent" and
"dfaclent" arrays appear in ascending order of their "type"
element value. Some receivers depend on this ordering. The
manufactured ACL described in {{no-acl-support}} is the one
exception among the implementations this document surveys.

<cref anchor="open-fabricated-acl" source="editor">
The Solaris entry order and class permission are described
in <xref target="no-acl-support"/> as behavior, not
identified as defects. If the working group reads either as
a bug to report rather than a variation to document, this
text and <xref target="no-acl-support"/> should say so. See
repository issue #2.
</cref>

When a client presents a SETACL operation that a server
finds is invalid or it cannot process, the server responds
with ACL2ERR_INVAL or ACL3ERR_INVAL, depending on the version
of NFS_ACL that is in use. ACLs that are not valid include:

* The presented ACL does not contain one ACE for each of
  NA_USER_OBJ, NA_GROUP_OBJ, and NA_OTHER_OBJ
* The presented ACL is a default ACL but the target object
  is not a directory
* The presented ACL contains too many ACEs
* The presented ACL contains an ACE whose "type" field
  sets more than one of the base type values NA_USER_OBJ,
  NA_USER, NA_GROUP_OBJ, NA_GROUP, NA_CLASS_OBJ, and
  NA_OTHER_OBJ (the NA_ACL_DEFAULT flag may accompany
  exactly one such value)
* The presented ACL contains an ACE whose type or perm
  field has a bit set that is not defined by this protocol

The NA_ACL_DEFAULT bit is a flag that a sender combines with
one of the base type values (for example, NA_ACL_DEFAULT |
NA_USER_OBJ) to mark an Access Control Entry as a default
entry: one that a directory contributes to its newly created
children rather than one that controls access to the directory
itself. Every entry in the "dfaclent" array has the
NA_ACL_DEFAULT bit set in its "type" field, and no entry in the
"aclent" array has it set. Segregating default entries into the
separate "dfaclent" array makes the flag redundant on the wire;
a sender nonetheless sets it on every "dfaclent" entry so that a
receiver can reconstruct the single, flag-tagged Access Control
list that some file access APIs present to applications.

The "id" field in an Access Control Entry is interpreted as follows:

* For an ACE that specifies an NA_USER_OBJ, NA_USER,
NA_GROUP, and NA_GROUP_OBJ, the "id" field contains
a UID or GID value that identifies the user on the
server whose access permission is being set.

* For an ACE that specifies other types of permission (for
example, NA_CLASS_OBJ or NA_OTHER_OBJ), the "id" field is
undefined. A sender sets this field to zero, and a receiver
ignores its value.

#### Relationship Between ACLs and Other File Attributes

When an ACL is present on a file, the ACL controls the
requesting user's access to the file. Typically the NFS
server ignores the file's mode bits.

Depending on the behavior of the local file system
implementation, changing the file's ACL via the SETACL
procedure may alter the file's mode bits, and changing
the mode bits via the SETATTR procedure may alter the
content of the ACL in any way. NFS clients should
refresh cached ACLs or file modes after one of these
operations.

When an ACL is present on a file, changing the file's owner
(say, via the SETATTR operation) may alter the server's
interpretation of any ACE that targets NA_USER_OBJ.

When an ACL is present on a file, changing the file's group
(say, via the SETATTR operation) may alter the server's
interpretation of any ACE that targets NA_GROUP_OBJ.

If an NFS client observes that a file's ctime attribute
has changed, it should assume that any ACLs that are
present might have been modified.

#### ACL Inheritance

A client uses one of the NFS CREATE, MKDIR, or MKNOD procedures
to request instantiation of a new file object. When the parent
directory carries a default ACL (that is, a non-empty "dfaclent"
array), the server forms the new object's access ACL from that
default ACL, copying each default entry into the new object's
access ACL with the NA_ACL_DEFAULT flag cleared so that the
entry governs access to the new object.

The default ACL also constrains the new object's mode bits. The
server derives the owner permission bits from the default
NA_USER_OBJ entry, the other permission bits from the default
NA_OTHER_OBJ entry, and the group permission bits from the
default NA_CLASS_OBJ (mask) entry when one is present or else
from the default NA_GROUP_OBJ entry. The server first reduces
each of these three permission sets to its intersection with the
corresponding permission the client requested in the creation
operation. The reduced permissions become both the new object's
mode bits and the permissions of the corresponding entries in
its access ACL. Through this intersection a default ACL takes
the place of a umask in limiting the permissions of a newly
created object; see {{Gruenbacher}} for the relationship between
default ACLs and the umask.

When the newly created object is itself a directory, the server
also copies the parent's default ACL into the new directory's
own default ACL, so that the default ACL propagates to
subsequent descendants.

When the parent directory has no default ACL, the server assigns
no ACL to the new object, and the object's mode bits are those
the client requested in the creation operation.

#### Historical References

The section entitled "The POSIX 1003.1e/1003.2c Working Group"
in {{Gruenbacher}} details the history of POSIX standards efforts
with regard to file access control. The editor recommends that
readers familiarize themselves with the extent to which POSIX
specifies the content and behavior of ACLs.

# Protocol Elements Common to Both Versions

## RPC Authentication {#rpc-authentication}

The NFS_ACL service uses AUTH_NONE in the NULL procedure.
All RPC authentication flavors may be used for other procedures.

## Constants

These are the RPC constants needed to call the NFS Version 3
service.  They are given in decimal.

100227
: The RPC program number for the NFS_ACL protocol

Only versions 2 and 3 of this RPC program are valid.

## Transport address

The NFS_ACL protocol can operate over the TCP, UDP, and RDMA
transport protocols.
For TCP and UDP, it uses port 2049, and for RDMA, it uses 20049.
In both cases, this is the same as the base NFS protocol.

## Sizes

~~~ xdr
NFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES 1024
~~~

The maximum number of Access Control Entries allowed in one Access Control List array.

## Basic Data Types

The following XDR definitions are basic scalar types that are used in other structures.

~~~ xdr
typedef unsigned int uid;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef unsigned short o_mode;
~~~

## Structured Data types

The following XDR definitions are common structured data types
that are used in all versions of the NFS_ACL protocol.

### aclent

This structure represents a single entry in an Access Control List.

~~~ xdr
struct aclent {
    int type;
    uid id;
    o_mode perm;
};
~~~

The "type" element in an Access Control Entry is a bit mask.
The bit field values in this mask are defined as follows:

~~~ xdr
const NA_USER_OBJ = 0x1;        /* object owner */
const NA_USER = 0x2;            /* additional users */
const NA_GROUP_OBJ = 0x4;       /* owning group of the object */
const NA_GROUP = 0x8;           /* additional groups */
const NA_CLASS_OBJ = 0x10;      /* file group class and mask entry */
const NA_OTHER_OBJ = 0x20;      /* other entry for the object */
const NA_ACL_DEFAULT = 0x1000;  /* default flag */
~~~

The "perm" element in an Access Control Entry is also a bit mask.
The bit field values in this mask are defined as follows:

~~~ xdr
const NA_READ = 0x4;            /* read permission */
const NA_WRITE = 0x2;           /* write permission */
const NA_EXEC = 0x1;            /* exec permission */
~~~

### secattr

The secattr structure represents, on the wire, the full Access Control
List for one file system object. This list contains an array of
Access Control Entries that apply to the object, plus an array of
default Access Control Entries that are inherited by the object's
children.

~~~ xdr
struct secattr {
    unsigned int mask;
    int aclcnt;
    aclent aclent<NFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES>;
    int dfaclcnt;
    aclent dfaclent<NFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES>;
};
~~~

The "mask" element of the secattr structure is a bit mask. The
bit field values in this mask are defined as follows:

~~~ xdr
const NA_ACL = 0x1;         /* aclent contains a valid list */
const NA_ACLCNT = 0x2;      /* number of entries in the aclent list */
const NA_DFACL = 0x4;       /* dfaclent contains a valid list */
const NA_DFACLCNT = 0x8;    /* number of entries in the dfaclent list */
~~~

These bit field values are also used in the "mask" element of the
GETACL2args and GETACL3args structures.

#### The "mask" Element in a SETACL Request {#setacl-mask}

In a GETACL request the "mask" element selects which fields
the server fills in, as described in {{getacl2}} and
{{getacl3}}. Implementations do not agree on what the
element means in a SETACL request.

The Linux NFS server treats it as selective there as well.
It replaces the object's access ACL only when NA_ACL is set,
and the object's default ACL only when NA_DFACL is set,
leaving an unselected list as it found it.

The Solaris NFS_ACL server does not consult the element on
SETACL, and the outcome depends on the file system it
exports. When that file system is UFS, the server stores
exactly the entries the request carries, so the entries of a
list the sender leaves empty are dropped from the object
rather than preserved. When it is ZFS, the server returns
ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP or ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP as described in
{{no-acl-support}}.

A SETACL that sets one of the two bits and clears the other
therefore has no single meaning. Sent to a directory that
holds both an access ACL and a default ACL, it preserves the
unselected list on a Linux server and drops that list's
entries on a Solaris server exporting UFS.

A client avoids the divergence by setting both bits and
sending both lists on every SETACL, reading back the list it
does not intend to change so that it can send that list
unaltered. The Linux NFS client does this: it sets NA_ACL on
every SETACL, adds NA_DFACL for a directory, and fetches the
sibling list before sending.

<cref anchor="open-setacl-mask" source="editor">
This section records the divergence rather than recommending
one behavior. A client that follows the last paragraph is
safe against either server, but a server implementer is left
without an answer. Does the working group want to choose
one? See repository issue #1.
</cref>

### Interoperability Considerations

Interoperability between NFS peers that do not implement
the NFS_ACL protocol is what we already have today.
Interoperability between peers that both implement the NFS_ACL
protocol is described in the rest of this document.

The following subsections briefly discuss three new
interoperability scenarios.

#### Client Implements NFS_ACL, Server Does Not

Typically an NFS server that implements the NFS_ACL program will
advertise the presence of NFS_ACL via an rpcbind registration.
An NFS client that implements NFS_ACL should perform an rpcbind
query before attempting any NFS_ACL procedure {{?RFC1833}}.

If the client sends any NFS_ACL procedure without sending an
rpcbind query first, and the server does not implement the
NFS_ACL program, the server responds with an RPC access_stat
of PROG_UNAVAIL.

#### Server Implements NFS_ACL, Client Does Not

An NFS server that implements advanced access control can
deny requests made by a client by responding with
NFS2ERR_ACCESS or NFS3ERR_ACCESS status codes, and an
NFS client has no visibility as to why the denial occurred.
Neither can that client send operations to update
the access control on file objects.

This is a quality of implementation issue for the client.

#### Client Implements, Exported File System Does Not {#no-acl-support}

An NFS server that implements the NFS_ACL protocol might
share both file systems that implement ACLs and
file systems that do not. In this case, NFS clients
detect the presence of an NFS_ACL service on the NFS
server.

This is not an unusual case. A Solaris server exporting a
ZFS file system behaves as this section describes for every
object it shares: GETACL returns a manufactured ACL, and
SETACL fails. The behavior described here is therefore the
ordinary one for a Solaris server on its default file
system, not a fallback reserved for file systems without
access control.

For file objects that do not implement ACL support:

* The server responds to a GETACL procedure by returning
a manufactured minimal ACL that reflects the current mode
bits of the object. Both surveyed servers manufacture four
Access Control Entries in the "aclent" array and leave the
"dfaclent" array empty; neither manufactures a default ACL.
The Solaris server departs from the rules given in
{{acls-in-operation}} on this path. It sets the
NA_CLASS_OBJ entry's "perm" element to the constant value 7
rather than deriving it from the owning group's permission
bits, and it emits the entries in the order NA_USER_OBJ,
NA_GROUP_OBJ, NA_OTHER_OBJ, NA_CLASS_OBJ, which is not
ascending order of "type" value.

* The server responds to a SETACL version 3 procedure by
returning ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP.

* The server responds to a SETACL version 2 procedure by
returning ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP.

The Linux NFS server deviates from the protocol specified in the
current document by returning the value 10004 (the NFS version 3
NFS3ERR_NOTSUPP value) rather than the value 45 that this document
assigns to ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP, in response to a SETACL version 2
procedure on a file system that does not support ACLs.

# NFS_ACL Version 2

Version 2 of the NFS_ACL protocol is used in conjunction only with
version 2 of the NFS protocol.

## Data types inherited from NFS version 2

### ftype

The enumeration "ftype" gives the type of an NFS version 2 file.
This definition comes from {{Section 2.3.2 of RFC1094}}:

~~~ xdr
enum ftype {
    NFNON = 0,
    NFREG = 1,
    NFDIR = 2,
    NFBLK = 3,
    NFCHR = 4,
    NFLNK = 5
};
~~~

### fhandle

NFS version 2 uses a fixed-size file handle. The following definition
comes from {{Section 2.3.3 of RFC1094}}:

~~~ xdr
const FHSIZE = 32;

typedef opaque fhandle[FHSIZE];
~~~

### timeval

NFS version 2's "timeval" structure represents the number of seconds
and microseconds since midnight January 1, 1970, Greenwich Mean Time.
This definition comes from {{Section 2.3.4 of RFC1094}}:

~~~ xdr
struct timeval {
    unsigned int seconds;
    unsigned int useconds;
};
~~~

###  nfsfattr

This document refers to NFS version 2's file attribute structure
as "nfsfattr". This is the same as the fattr structure described
in {{Section 2.3.5 of RFC1094}}:

~~~ xdr
struct fattr {
    ftype        type;
    unsigned int mode;
    unsigned int nlink;
    unsigned int uid;
    unsigned int gid;
    unsigned int size;
    unsigned int blocksize;
    unsigned int rdev;
    unsigned int blocks;
    unsigned int fsid;
    unsigned int fileid;
    timeval      atime;
    timeval      mtime;
    timeval      ctime;
};
~~~

### Defined Error Numbers

{{Section 2.3.1 of RFC1094}} describes an enumerated type called
"stat" which provides a status code for NFS version 2 results.
A matching type called "aclstat2" is defined in this document
for the similar purpose of returning NFS_ACL version 2 procedure
status codes. The numeric values of these two types match up,
though aclstat2 omits some codes that are not relevant to the
NFS_ACL protocol.

The "stat" type in {{Section 2.3.1 of RFC1094}} does not define a
status code corresponding to the POSIX EINVAL error. However,
existing NFS_ACL version 2 server implementations return the value
22 (the numeric value of EINVAL) when a client presents an invalid
argument to a procedure. The aclstat2 type therefore defines
ACL2ERR_INVAL with that value, even though the NFS version 2 "stat"
type has no matching code.

Similarly, the "stat" type does not define a status code that
reports that a requested operation is not supported. The Solaris
NFS_ACL version 2 server returns the value 45 (its NFSERR_OPNOTSUPP
status code) when a client directs an operation at a file object
whose file system does not support ACLs. The aclstat2 type therefore
defines ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP with that value. This value matches the one
that the sole existing NFS_ACL version 2 client (the Solaris
implementation) decodes to the POSIX EOPNOTSUPP error; the numeric
value 10004 that NFS version 3 assigns to NFS3ERR_NOTSUPP is not used
in NFS_ACL version 2 results.

~~~ xdr
enum aclstat2 {
    ACL2_OK = 0,
    ACL2ERR_PERM = 1,
    ACL2ERR_NOENT = 2,
    ACL2ERR_IO = 5,
    ACL2ERR_ACCES = 13,
    ACL2ERR_INVAL = 22,
    ACL2ERR_NOSPC = 28,
    ACL2ERR_ROFS = 30,
    ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP = 45,
    ACL2ERR_DQUOT = 69,
    ACL2ERR_STALE = 70
};
~~~

These status codes carry the following meanings:

ACL2ERR_PERM
: Not owner. The caller does not have correct ownership to perform the requested operation.

ACL2ERR_NOENT
: No such file or directory. The file or directory name specified does not exist.

ACL2ERR_IO
: Some sort of hard error occurred when the operation was in progress.  This could be a disk error, for example.

ACL2ERR_ACCES
: Permission denied.  The caller does not have the correct permission to perform the requested operation.

ACL2ERR_INVAL
: An invalid or unsupported argument was specified for procedure.

ACL2ERR_NOSPC
: No space left on device.  The operation caused the server's file system to reach its limit.

ACL2ERR_ROFS
: Read-only file system.  Write attempted on a read-only file system.

ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP
: Operation is not supported.

ACL2ERR_DQUOT
: Disk quota exceeded.  The client's disk quota on the server has been exceeded.

ACL2ERR_STALE
: The "fhandle" given in the arguments was invalid.  That is, the file referred to by that file handle no longer exists, or access to it has been revoked.

## Server Procedures

### Procedure 0: NULL - No Operation

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
void;
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
void;
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

This is the usual NULL procedure with a void argument and void result.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

It is important that this procedure do no work at all so that clients
can use it to measure the overhead of processing a service request.
By convention, the NULL procedure should never require any
authentication.
A server implementation may choose to ignore this convention, if
responding to the NULL procedure call acknowledges the existence
of a resource to an unauthenticated client.

#### ERRORS

Since the NULL procedure returns no result, it can not return an
NFS_ACL error status code. However, some server implementations may
return RPC-level errors based on security or authentication policy
settings.

### Procedure 1: GETACL - Retrieve an Access Control List {#getacl2}

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETACL2args {
    fhandle fh;
    unsigned int mask;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETACL2resok {
    fattr attr;
    secattr acl;
};

union GETACL2res switch (aclstat2 status) {
case ACL2_OK:
    GETACL2resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The GETACL procedure retrieves Access Control List
information associated with the file system object
specified by the GETACL2args.fh field. The client
obtains this file handle using one of the NFS
version 2 LOOKUP, CREATE, MKDIR, or SYMLINK procedures,
or the MOUNT service, as described in {{RFC1094}}.

The GETACL2args.mask field specifies which information
is to be returned in the response:

* If the NA_ACL bit is set, the server fills in the
object's access ACL.
* If the NA_ACLCNT bit is set, the server fills in
the number of ACEs that are in the object's access ACL.
* If the NA_DFACL bit is set, the server fills in
the object's default ACL.
* if the NA_DFACLCNT bit is set, the server fills in
the number of ACEs that are in the object's default ACL.

If the GETACL procedure is successful, the server sets the
GETACL2res.status field to ACL2_OK. It fills in the
GETACL2resok.attr field with the file object's current
file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1094}}. Lastly,
it fills in the GETACL2res.acl field with two counted
arrays of Access Control Entries (ACEs).

Otherwise, GETACL2res.status contains an error status
on failure and no other results are returned.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

When GETACL2args.fh represents a file object that does not currently
have an ACL associated with it or does not implement support
for ACLs, the server responds by returning a manufactured
minimal NFS ACL that reflects the current owner, group, and
mode bits of the object (see {{acls-in-operation}}).

A default ACL applies only to a directory object. When
GETACL2args.fh represents an object that is not a directory,
that object has no default ACL. If the request's NA_DFACL or
NA_DFACLCNT bit is set, the server returns an empty dfaclent
array and a dfaclcnt of zero rather than reporting an error.

#### ERRORS

- ACL2ERR_IO
- ACL2ERR_STALE

### Procedure 2: SETACL - Set or replace an Access Control List

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct SETACL2args {
    fhandle fh;
    secattr acl;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct SETACL2resok {
    fattr attr;
};

union SETACL2res switch (aclstat2 status) {
case ACL2_OK:
    SETACL2resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The SETACL procedure replaces the Access Control Lists
associated with the file system object specified by the
SETACL2args.fh field with the ACLs specified by the
SETACL2args.acl field.  The client obtains the file
handle using one of the NFS version 2 LOOKUP, CREATE,
MKDIR, SYMLINK procedures, or the MOUNT service, as
described in {{RFC1094}}.

To remove extended access control from a file object, a client
uses SETACL to replace the object's ACL with a minimal NFS ACL
(see {{acls-in-operation}}).

If the SETACL procedure is successful, the server sets the
SETACL2res.status field to ACL2_OK and fills in the
SETACL2resok.attr field with the file object's new
file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1094}}.

Otherwise, SETACL2res.status contains an error status
on failure and no other results are returned.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

On success, the server does not send the reply until
the ACL change is durable locally.

Changing a file object's ACL changes the object's mtime.
The mtime change is reflected in the attributes returned
in the SETACL response.

A high-quality server implementation ensures that a
GETACL procedure running concurrently with a SETACL
procedure does not return partially updated (torn)
ACL contents. However, a failed SETACL may partially
change a file's ACLs.

When SETACL2args.fh represents a file object that does
not implement support for ACLs, the server responds by
setting SETACL2res.status to ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP.

When the new ACL does not contain at least the minimal
set of ACEs (as described in {{acls-in-operation}}), the
server responds by setting SETACL2res.status to
ACL2ERR_INVAL.

Servers differ in how they treat the "mask" element of
SETACL2args.acl. {{setacl-mask}} describes the divergence
and how a client avoids it.

#### ERRORS

- ACL2ERR_ROFS
- ACL2ERR_PERM
- ACL2ERR_IO
- ACL2ERR_ACCES
- ACL2ERR_INVAL
- ACL2ERR_NOSPC
- ACL2ERR_NOTSUPP
- ACL2ERR_DQUOT
- ACL2ERR_STALE

### Procedure 3: GETATTR - Get file attributes

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETATTR2args {
    fhandle fh;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETATTR2resok {
    fattr attr;
};

union GETATTR2res switch (aclstat2 status) {
case ACL2_OK:
    GETATTR2resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The GETATTR procedure retrieves the current file
attributes associated with the file system object
specified by the GETATTR2args.fh field. The client
obtains this file handle using one of the NFS
version 2 LOOKUP, CREATE, MKDIR, SYMLINK procedures,
or the MOUNT service, as described in {{RFC1094}}.

If the GETATTR procedure is successful, the server
sets the GETATTR2res.status field to ACL2_OK, and
fills in the GETATTR2resok.attr field with the file
object's current file attributes, as detailed in
{{RFC1094}}.

Otherwise, GETATTR2res.status contains an error
status on failure and no other results are returned.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

Refer to {{Section 2.3.5 of RFC1094}} for details
about the content of the returned file attributes.

#### ERRORS

- ACL2ERR_IO
- ACL2ERR_STALE

### Procedure 4: ACCESS - Check access permission

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct ACCESS2args {
    fhandle fh;
    unsigned int access;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
const ACCESS2_READ = 0x1;       /* read data or readdir a directory */
const ACCESS2_LOOKUP = 0x2;     /* lookup a name in a directory */
const ACCESS2_MODIFY = 0x4;     /* rewrite existing file data or */
                                /* modify existing directory entries */
const ACCESS2_EXTEND = 0x8;     /* write new data or add directory entries */
const ACCESS2_DELETE = 0x10;    /* delete existing directory entry */
const ACCESS2_EXECUTE = 0x20;   /* execute file (no meaning for a directory) */

struct ACCESS2resok {
    fattr attr;
    unsigned int access;
};

union ACCESS2res switch (aclstat2 status) {
case ACL2_OK:
    ACCESS2resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The ACCESS procedure determines the access rights
that a user, as identified by the RPC credentials
in the request, has with respect to the file handle
specified by the ACCESS2args.fh field. The client
obtains this file handle using one of the NFS
version 2 LOOKUP, CREATE, MKDIR, SYMLINK procedures,
or the MOUNT service, as described in {{RFC1094}}.
The client encodes the set of permissions that are
to be checked in the ACCESS2args.access field.

The following access permissions may be requested:

ACCESS2_READ
: Read data from file or read a directory.

ACCESS2_LOOKUP
: Look up a name in a directory (no meaning for non-directory objects).

ACCESS2_MODIFY
: Rewrite existing file data or modify existing directory entries.

ACCESS2_EXTEND
: Write new data or add directory entries.

ACCESS2_DELETE
: Delete an existing directory entry (no meaning for non-directory objects).

ACCESS2_EXECUTE
: Execute file (no meaning for a directory).

If the ACCESS procedure is successful, the server
sets the ACCESS2res.status field to ACL2_OK. It
fills in the ACCESS2resok.attr field with the file
object's current file attributes, as detailed in
{{RFC1094}}. Lastly, it encodes the set of
permissions that the requesting user is granted
in the ACCESS2resok.access field.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

In the NFS version 2 protocol, the only reliable way to
determine whether an operation is allowed is to try it
and see if it succeeded or failed. Using the ACCESS
procedure in the NFS_ACL version 2 protocol, a client can
ask the server to indicate whether or not one or more
classes of operations are permitted.

In general, it is not sufficient for a client to attempt
to deduce access permissions by inspecting the uid, gid,
and mode fields in the file attributes, since the server
may perform uid or gid mapping or enforce additional
access control restrictions. It is also possible that the
NFS version 2 protocol server may not be in the same ID
space as the NFS version 2 protocol client. In these cases,
the NFS version 2 protocol client can not reliably perform
an access check with only current file attributes.

The information returned by the server in response to an
ACCESS call is advisory only. It was correct at the exact
time that the server performed the checks, but not
necessarily afterwards. The server can revoke access
permission to a file object at any time.

The NFS_ACL version 2 protocol client should use the
effective credentials of the user to build the
authentication information in the ACCESS request used
to determine access rights. It is the effective user
and group credentials that are used in subsequent read
and write operations.

Many implementations do not directly support the
ACCESS2_DELETE permission. Operating systems like UNIX
may ignore the ACCESS2_DELETE bit if set on an access
request on a non-directory object. In these systems,
delete permission on a file is determined by the access
permissions on the directory in which the file resides,
instead of being determined by the permissions of the file
itself.  Thus, the bit mask returned for such a request
will have the ACCESS2_DELETE bit set to 0, indicating that
the client does not have this permission.

The server should return a status of ACL2_OK if no
errors occurred that prevented the server from making
the required access checks.

#### ERRORS

- ACL2ERR_IO
- ACL2ERR_STALE

### Procedure 5: GETXATTRDIR - Get named attribute directory

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETXATTRDIR2args {
    fhandle fh;
    bool create;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETXATTRDIR2resok {
    fhandle fh;
    fattr attr;
};

union GETXATTRDIR2res switch (aclstat2 status) {
case ACL2_OK:
    GETXATTRDIR2resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

{{Section 5.3 of RFC8881}} defines a set of generic file attributes known
as "named attributes". The GETXATTRDIR procedure extends this facility
into the NFSv2 protocol.

The GETXATTRDIR procedure obtains the file handle of the named attribute
directory associated with the file handle in the GETXATTRDIR2args.fh
field. This directory contains only objects of type NFREG.

If the GETXATTRDIR procedure is successful, the server sets the
GETXATTRDIR2res.status field to ACL2_OK.
It fills in the GETXATTRDIR2resok.fh field with a file handle that
the client may use to look up the target file's named attributes.
It fills in the GETXATTRDIR2resok.attr field with the name attribute
directory's current file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1094}}.

Using the file handle returned in GETXATTRDIR2resok.fh, a client
can utilize the READDIR and LOOKUP procedures to obtain file handles
for the named attributes associated with the target file system object.

If the target file object does not currently have a named attribute
directory associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR2args.create boolean
field is set to false, the server returns ACL2ERR_NOENT.
If the target file object does not currently have a named attribute
directory associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR2args.create boolean
field is set to true, the server attempts to create the named attribute
directory before returning a result.
If the target file currently has a named attribute directory
associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR2args.create boolean is set
to true, the server returns the file handle of that named attribute
directory.

If the RPC user does not have read access to the target file, or
if the GETXATTRDIR operation is to create a named attribute directory
and the RPC user does not have permission to do so, the server returns
ACL2ERR_ACCES in the GETXATTRDIR2.status field.

If the target file handle designates an object not of type NFREG or
NFDIR, the server returns the value ACL2ERR_INVAL in the GETXATTRDIR2.status
field. Neither named attributes nor named attribute directories have
their own named attributes.

Note: This operation is equivalent to the NFSv4 OPENATTR operation as
specified in {{Section 16.17 of RFC7530}} and {{Section 18.17 of RFC8881}}.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

Server implementers are free to choose not to implement this procedure.
In this case, the server returns the RPC-level error PROC_UNAVAIL.

If the server implementation does implement the GETXATTRDIR procedure
but the shared file system containing the file object specified by the
file handle in the GETXATTRDIR2args.fh field does not support named
attributes, the server returns ACL2ERR_IO in the GETXATTRDIR2.status
field.

#### ERRORS

- ACL2ERR_PERM
- ACL2ERR_NOENT
- ACL2ERR_IO
- ACL2ERR_ACCES
- ACL2ERR_INVAL
- ACL2ERR_NOSPC
- ACL2ERR_ROFS
- ACL2ERR_STALE

# NFS_ACL Version 3

Version 3 of the NFS_ACL protocol is used in conjunction only with
version 3 of the NFS protocol.

## Data types inherited from NFS version 3

### Scalar Data types

These are defined in {{Section 2.5 of RFC1813}}.

~~~ xdr
typedef unsigned hyper uint64;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef unsigned long uint32;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef uint64 fileid3;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef uint32 uid3;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef uint32 gid3;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef uint64 size3;
~~~

~~~ xdr
typedef uint32 mode3;
~~~

### ftype3

The enumeration "ftype3" represents the type of a file object.
This definition is further explained in {{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}}.

~~~ xdr
enum ftype3 {
    NF3REG    = 1,
    NF3DIR    = 2,
    NF3BLK    = 3,
    NF3CHR    = 4,
    NF3LNK    = 5,
    NF3SOCK   = 6,
    NF3FIFO   = 7
};
~~~

### specdata3

~~~ xdr
struct specdata3 {
    uint32     specdata1;
    uint32     specdata2;
};
~~~

The interpretation of the two words depends on the type of file
system object. For a block special (NF3BLK) or character special
(NF3CHR) file, specdata1 and specdata2 are the major and minor
device numbers, respectively. For all other file types, these
two elements should either be set to 0 or the values should be
agreed upon by the client and server.

Further detail is available in {{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}}.

### nfs_fh3

The nfs_fh3 data type is a variable-length opaque object returned
by the NFS version 3 LOOKUP, CREATE, SYMLINK, MKNOD, LINK,
or READDIRPLUS procedures.
A client uses this handle during subsequent NFS operations
to reference the file. This definition comes from
{{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}}.

~~~ xdr
NFS3_FHSIZE 64
~~~

The maximum size in bytes of the opaque file handle.

~~~ xdr
struct nfs_fh3 {
    opaque       data<NFS3_FHSIZE>;
};
~~~

To the client, a file handle is opaque. The client stores file
handles for use in a later request and can compare two file
handles from the same server for equality by doing a
byte-by-byte comparison, but cannot otherwise interpret the
contents of file handles. Further, if two file handles from the
same server are equal, they must refer to the same file, but if
they are not equal, no conclusions can be drawn.

Servers may revoke access provided by a file handle at any
time. If the file handle passed in a call refers to a file
system object that no longer exists on the server or access for
that file handle has been revoked, the error, ACL3ERR_STALE,
is returned.

### nfstime3

NFS version 3's "nfstime3" structure represents the number of
seconds and nanoseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 Greenwich
Mean Time. Further details are in {{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}}.

~~~ xdr
struct nfstime3 {
    uint32   seconds;
    uint32   nseconds;
};
~~~

### nfsfattr3

This document refers to NFS version 3's file attribute structure
as "nfsfattr3". This is the same as the fattr3 structure described
in {{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}}. A definition of the bit fields in
the "mode" element, which relate to traditional file system access
permissions, can also be found there.

~~~ xdr
struct fattr3 {
    ftype3     type;
    mode3      mode;
    uint32     nlink;
    uid3       uid;
    gid3       gid;
    size3      size;
    size3      used;
    specdata3  rdev;
    uint64     fsid;
    fileid3    fileid;
    nfstime3   atime;
    nfstime3   mtime;
    nfstime3   ctime;
};
~~~

### post_op_attr

The NFS version 3 "post_op_attr" data type returns file
attributes that are not directly involved in the requested
procedure. See {{Section 2.6 of RFC1813}} for more
information.

~~~ xdr
union post_op_attr switch (bool attributes_follow) {
case TRUE:
    fattr3   attributes;
case FALSE:
    void;
};
~~~

The format of this data type appears to make returning file
attributes optional. However, server implementers are strongly
encouraged to make a best effort to return attributes whenever
possible, even when returning an error.

## Error Values

{{Section 2.5 of RFC1813}} describes an enumerated type called
"nfsstat3" which provides a status code for NFS version 3 procedure
results.
A matching type called "aclstat3" is defined in this document
for the similar purpose of returning NFS_ACL version 3 procedure
status codes. The numeric values of these two types match up,
although aclstat3 omits some codes that are not relevant to the
NFS_ACL protocol.

~~~ xdr
enum aclstat3 {
    ACL3_OK             = 0,
    ACL3ERR_PERM        = 1,
    ACL3ERR_NOENT       = 2,
    ACL3ERR_IO          = 5,
    ACL3ERR_ACCES       = 13,
    ACL3ERR_INVAL       = 22,
    ACL3ERR_NOSPC       = 28,
    ACL3ERR_ROFS        = 30,
    ACL3ERR_DQUOT       = 69,
    ACL3ERR_STALE       = 70,
    ACL3ERR_BADHANDLE   = 10001,
    ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP     = 10004,
    ACL3ERR_SERVERFAULT = 10006,
    ACL3ERR_JUKEBOX     = 10008
};
~~~

These status codes carry the following meanings:

ACL3_OK
: Indicates the call completed successfully.

ACL3ERR_PERM
: Not owner. The operation was not allowed because the caller is either not a privileged user (root) or not the owner of the target of the operation.

ACL3ERR_NOENT
: No such file or directory. The file or directory name specified does not exist.

ACL3ERR_IO
: I/O error. A hard error (for example, a disk error) occurred while processing the requested operation.

ACL3ERR_ACCES
: Permission denied. The caller does not have the correct permission to perform the requested operation. Contrast this with NFS3ERR_PERM, which restricts itself to owner or privileged user permission failures.

ACL3ERR_INVAL
: An invalid or unsupported argument was specified for procedure.

ACL3ERR_NOSPC
: No space left on device. The operation would have caused the server's file system to exceed its limit.

ACL3ERR_ROFS
: Read-only file system. A modifying operation was attempted on a read-only file system.

ACL3ERR_DQUOT
: Resource (quota) hard limit exceeded. The user's resource limit on the server has been exceeded.

ACL3ERR_STALE
: Invalid file handle. The file handle given in the arguments was invalid. The file referred to by that file handle no longer exists or access to it has been revoked.

ACL3ERR_BADHANDLE
: Illegal NFS file handle. The file handle failed internal consistency checks.

ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP
: Operation is not supported.

ACL3ERR_SERVERFAULT
: An error occurred on the server which does not map to any of the legal NFS version 3 protocol error values.  The client should translate this into an appropriate error. UNIX clients may choose to translate this to EIO.

ACL3ERR_JUKEBOX
: The server initiated the request, but was not able to complete it in a timely fashion. The client should wait and then try the request with a new RPC transaction ID. For example, this error should be returned from a server that supports hierarchical storage and receives a request to process a file that has been migrated. In this case, the server should start the immigration process and respond to client with this error.

## Server Procedures

### Procedure 0: NULL - No Operation

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
void;
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
void;
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

This is the usual NULL procedure with a void argument and void result.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

It is important that this procedure do no work at all so that clients
can use it to measure the overhead of processing a service request.
By convention, the NULL procedure should never require any
authentication.
A server implementation may choose to ignore this convention, if
responding to the NULL procedure call acknowledges the existence
of a resource to an unauthenticated client.

#### ERRORS

Since the NULL procedure takes no argument and returns no
result, it can not return an NFS or NFS_ACL error status code.
However, some server implementations may return RPC errors
based on security or authentication policy settings.

### Procedure 1: GETACL - Retrieve an Access Control List {#getacl3}

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETACL3args {
    nfs_fh3 fh;
    unsigned int mask;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETACL3resok {
    post_op_attr attr;
    secattr acl;
};

struct GETACL3resfail {
    post_op_attr attr;
};

union GETACL3res switch (aclstat3 status) {
case ACL3_OK:
    GETACL3resok resok;
default:
    GETACL3resfail resfail;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The GETACL procedure retrieves Access Control List
information associated with the file system object
specified by the GETACL3args.fh field. The client
obtains this file handle using one of the NFS
version 2 LOOKUP, CREATE, MKDIR, SYMLINK, MKNOD,
or READDIRPLUS procedures, or the MOUNT service,
as described in {{RFC1813}}.

The GETACL3args.mask field specifies which information
is to be returned in the response:

* If the NA_ACL bit is set, the server fills in the
object's access ACL.
* If the NA_ACLCNT bit is set, the server fills in
the number of ACEs that are in the object's access ACL.
* If the NA_DFACL bit is set, the server fills in
the object's default ACL.
* if the NA_DFACLCNT bit is set, the server fills in
the number of ACEs that are in the object's default ACL.

If the GETACL procedure is successful, the server sets the
GETACL3res.status field to ACL3_OK. It fills in the
GETACL3resok.attr field with the file object's post
operation file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1813}}.
Lastly, it fills in the GETACL3resok.acl field with two
counted arrays of Access Control Entries (ACEs).

Otherwise, GETACL3res.status contains an error status
on failure and no other results are returned.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

When GETACL3args.fh represents a file object that does
not currently have an ACL associated with it or does not
implement support for ACLs, the server responds by
returning a manufactured minimal NFS ACL that reflects
the current owner, group, and mode bits of the object
(see {{acls-in-operation}}).

A default ACL applies only to a directory object. When
GETACL3args.fh represents an object that is not a directory,
that object has no default ACL. If the request's NA_DFACL or
NA_DFACLCNT bit is set, the server returns an empty dfaclent
array and a dfaclcnt of zero rather than reporting an error.

#### ERRORS

- ACL3ERR_IO
- ACL3ERR_STALE
- ACL3ERR_BADHANDLE
- ACL3ERR_SERVERFAULT
- ACL3ERR_JUKEBOX

### Procedure 2: SETACL - Set or replace an Access Control List

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct SETACL3args {
    nfs_fh3 fh;
    secattr acl;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct SETACL3resok {
    post_op_attr attr;
};

struct SETACL3resfail {
    post_op_attr attr;
};

union SETACL3res switch (aclstat3 status) {
case ACL3_OK:
    SETACL3resok resok;
default:
    SETACL3resfail resfail;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

The SETACL procedure replaces the Access Control Lists
associated with the file system object specified by the
SETACL3args.fh field with the ACLs specified by the
SETACL3args.acl field.  The client obtains the file
handle using one of the NFS version 3 LOOKUP, CREATE,
MKDIR, MKNOD, SYMLINK, or READDIRPLUS procedures, or
the MOUNT service, as described in {{RFC1813}}.

To remove extended access control from a file object, a client
uses SETACL to replace the object's ACL with a minimal NFS ACL
(see {{acls-in-operation}}).

If the SETACL procedure is successful, the server sets
the SETACL3res.status field to ACL3_OK and fills in the
SETACL3resok.attr field with the file object's post
operation file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1813}}.

Otherwise, SETACL3res.status contains an error status
on failure and no other results are returned.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

On success, the server does not send the reply until
the ACL change is durable locally.

Changing a file object's ACL changes the object's mtime.
The mtime change is reflected in the attributes returned
in the SETACL response.

A high-quality server implementation ensures that a
GETACL procedure running concurrently with a SETACL
procedure does not return partially updated (torn)
ACL contents. However, a failed SETACL may partially
change a file's ACLs.

When SETACL3args.fh represents a file object that does
not implement support for ACLs, the server responds
by setting SETACL3res.status to ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP.

When SETACL3args.acl does not contain at least the
minimal set of ACEs (as described in
{{acls-in-operation}}), the server responds by setting
SETACL3res.status to ACL3ERR_INVAL.

Servers differ in how they treat the "mask" element of
SETACL3args.acl. {{setacl-mask}} describes the divergence
and how a client avoids it.

#### ERRORS

- ACL3ERR_PERM
- ACL3ERR_IO
- ACL3ERR_ACCES
- ACL3ERR_INVAL
- ACL3ERR_NOSPC
- ACL3ERR_ROFS
- ACL3ERR_DQUOT
- ACL3ERR_STALE
- ACL3ERR_BADHANDLE
- ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP
- ACL3ERR_SERVERFAULT
- ACL3ERR_JUKEBOX

### Procedure 3: GETXATTRDIR - Get named attribute directory

#### ARGUMENTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETXATTRDIR3args {
    nfs_fh3 fh;
    bool create;
};
~~~

#### RESULTS

~~~ xdr
struct GETXATTRDIR3resok {
    nfs_fh3 fh;
    post_op_attr attr;
};

union GETXATTRDIR3res switch (aclstat3 status) {
case ACL3_OK:
    GETXATTRDIR3resok resok;
default:
    void;
};
~~~

#### DESCRIPTION

{{Section 5.3 of RFC8881}} defines a set of generic file attributes known
as "named attributes". The GETXATTRDIR procedure extends this facility
into the NFSv3 protocol.

The GETXATTRDIR procedure obtains the file handle of the named attribute
directory associated with the file handle in the GETXATTRDIR3args.fh
field. This directory contains only objects of type NF3REG.

If the GETXATTRDIR procedure is successful, the server sets the
GETXATTRDIR3res.status field to ACL3_OK.
It fills in the GETXATTRDIR3resok.fh field with a file handle that
the client may use to look up the target file's named attributes.
It fills in the GETXATTRDIR3resok.attr field with the name attribute
directory's current file attributes, as detailed in {{RFC1813}}.

Using the file handle returned in GETXATTRDIR3resok.fh, a client
can utilize the READDIR and LOOKUP procedures to obtain file handles
for the named attributes associated with the target file system object.

If the target file object does not currently have a named attribute
directory associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR3args.create boolean
field is set to false, the server returns ACL3ERR_NOENT.
If the target file object does not currently have a named attribute
directory associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR3args.create boolean
field is set to true, the server attempts to create the named attribute
directory before returning a result.
If the target file currently has a named attribute directory
associated with it and the GETXATTRDIR3args.create boolean is set
to true, the server returns the file handle of that named attribute
directory.

If the RPC user does not have read access to the target file, or
if the GETXATTRDIR operation is to create a named attribute directory
and the RPC user does not have permission to do so, the server returns
ACL3_ACCES in the GETXATTRDIR3.status field.

If the target file handle designates an object not of type NF3REG or
NF3DIR, the server returns the value ACL3ERR_INVAL in the
GETXATTRDIR3.status field. Neither named attributes nor named attribute
directories have their own named attributes.

Note: This operation is equivalent to the NFSv4 OPENATTR operation as
specified in {{Section 16.17 of RFC7530}} and {{Section 18.17 of RFC8881}}.

#### IMPLEMENTATION

Server implementers are free to choose not to implement this procedure.
In this case, the server returns the RPC-level error PROC_UNAVAIL.

If the server implementation does implement the GETXATTRDIR procedure
but the shared file system containing the file object specified by the
file handle in the GETXATTRDIR3args.fh field does not support named
attributes, the server returns ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP in the GETXATTRDIR3.status
field.

#### ERRORS

- ACL3ERR_PERM
- ACL3ERR_NOENT
- ACL3ERR_IO
- ACL3ERR_ACCES
- ACL3ERR_INVAL
- ACL3ERR_NOSPC
- ACL3ERR_ROFS
- ACL3ERR_STALE
- ACL3ERR_NOTSUPP
- ACL3ERR_SERVERFAULT
- ACL3ERR_JUKEBOX

# Implementation Issues

## Permission issues {#permission-issues}

The NFS protocol, strictly speaking, does not
define the permission checking used by NFS servers. However, it
is expected that an NFS server will do normal operating system
permission checking using AUTH_UNIX style authentication as
the basis of its protection mechanism, or another stronger
form of authentication such as RPCSEC_GSS. With
AUTH_UNIX authentication, the server gets the client's
effective uid, effective gid, and groups on each call and
uses them to check permission. These are the so-called UNIX
credentials.

Using uid and gid implies that the client and server share
the same uid list. Every server and client pair must have the
same mapping from user to uid and from group to gid. Since
every client can also be a server, this tends to imply that
the whole network shares the same uid/gid space. If this is
not the case, then it usually falls upon the server to
perform some custom mapping of credentials from one
authentication domain into another. A discussion of
techniques for managing a shared user space or for providing
mechanisms for user ID mapping is beyond the scope of this
specification.

In POSIX-based operating systems, a particular user (on UNIX, the
uid 0) has access to all files, no matter what permission and
ownership they have. This superuser permission may not be
allowed on the server, since anyone who can become superuser
on their client could gain access to all remote files. A
POSIX-based NFS server by default maps uid 0 to a distinguished
value (for instance, UID_NOBODY), as well as mapping the groups
list, before doing its access checking. A server implementation
may provide a mechanism to change this mapping.

## Duplicate Request Cache {#dup-req-cache}

The typical NFS protocol failure recovery model
uses client time-out and retry to handle server crashes,
network partitions, and lost server replies. A retried
request is referred to as a duplicate of the original.

When used in a file server context, the term idempotent can
be used to distinguish between operation types. An idempotent
request is one that a server can perform more than once with
equivalent results (though it may in fact change, as a side
effect, the access time on a file, say for READ). Some NFS
operations are obviously non-idempotent. They cannot be
reprocessed without special attention simply because they may
fail if tried a second time. A CREATE request, for example,
can be used to create a file for which the owner does not
have write permission. A duplicate of this request cannot
succeed if the original succeeded. Likewise, a file can be
removed only once.

The side effects caused by performing a duplicate
non-idempotent request can be destructive. A duplicate
file truncation can result in lost writes. It is the
inherent stateless design of the NFS protocol on top
of an unreliable RPC transport that yields the
possibility of destructive replays of non-idempotent
requests. Even in an implementation of the NFS protocol
over a reliable connection-oriented transport,
a connection break with automatic reestablishment
requires duplicate request processing: the client
retransmits requests that were pending before the
connection loss, and the server needs to recognize
and deal with potential duplicate non-idempotent requests.

Most NFS server implementations maintain a cache of
recent requests, called the duplicate request cache,
for recognizing duplicate non-idempotent requests. If
the server receives a request and recognizes it as a
duplicate of a recently completed request, the server
returns the original completion status instead of
processing the duplicate request again.

A description of an early implementation of a
duplicate request cache can be found in {{Juszczak}}.

For all versions of the NFS_ACL protocol, the SETACL
procedure is considered to be non-idempotent.

## Caching Policies

The NFS protocol does not define a policy for
caching on the client or server. In particular, there is no
support for strict cache consistency between a client and
server, nor between different clients.

The NFS_ACL protocol does not mandate a specific caching
policy for ACLs or information retrieved via the ACCESS
procedure. However, a high-quality client implementation
that seeks good performance might choose to revalidate
cached access control information with the same regularity
that it invalidates normal file attributes.

# XDR Protocol Definition

This section contains a description of the core features of the
NFS_ACL protocol, version 2 and version 3, expressed in the XDR
language {{RFC4506}}.

NFS_ACL version 2 and NFS_ACL version 3 are independent versions of
a single RPC program.  Their XDR definitions are given here as two
separate specifications, one in {{nfs-acl-v2-xdr}} and one in
{{nfs-acl-v3-xdr}}, and each version is intended to form its own XDR
file.  Presenting the two versions as separate files lets an
implementer extract and compile only the protocol version of
interest.  The code component license and the data types common to both
versions appear once, in {{code-component-license}}.  Prepending
those common definitions to the definitions of a single version
yields a complete, independently compilable XDR file for that
version: nfs_acl2.x for version 2, and nfs_acl3.x for version 3.

This description is provided in a way that makes it simple to
extract into ready-to-compile form.  In the sections that follow,
each line of XDR text is preceded by the marker "///".  A line of
the form "/// @@FILE name" marks the start of the version-specific
definitions belonging to the file "name"; the XDR text preceding
the first such marker, in {{code-component-license}}, is common to
both files.  The reader can apply the following shell script to this
document to extract the two XDR files.

~~~ sh
#!/bin/sh
awk '
  /^ *\/\/\// {
    line = $0
    sub(/^ *\/\/\/ ?/, "", line)
    if (line ~ /^@@FILE /) { split(line, a, " "); f = a[2]; next }
    if (f == "") common = common line "\n"
    else         part[f] = part[f] line "\n"
    next
  }
  END { for (f in part) printf "%s%s", common, part[f] > f }
'
~~~

That is, if the above script is stored in a file called
"extract.sh" and this document is in a file called "spec.txt", then

~~~ sh
sh extract.sh < spec.txt
~~~

writes two files into the current directory: nfs_acl2.x, containing
the common definitions followed by the NFS_ACL version 2 definitions
of {{nfs-acl-v2-xdr}}, and nfs_acl3.x, containing the common
definitions followed by the NFS_ACL version 3 definitions of
{{nfs-acl-v3-xdr}}.  Each file is a complete and independently
compilable XDR description of one protocol version.

##  Code Component License {#code-component-license}

Code components extracted from this document must include
the following license text.  When the extracted XDR code
is combined with other complementary XDR code which itself
has an identical license, only a single copy of the license
text need be preserved.

# Implementation Status

{:aside}
> This section is to be removed before publishing this document as an RFC.

This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
{{!RFC7942}}. The description of implementations in this section is
intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
drafts to RFCs.

Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has
been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be
construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
exist.

## Solaris NFS server and client

Organization: Oracle

URL:       <https://www.oracle.com>

Maturity:  Complete.

Coverage:  All procedures are implemented.

Licensing: CDDL

Implementation experience:

## Linux NFS server and client

Organization:  The Linux Foundation

URL:       <https://www.kernel.org>

Maturity:  Complete.

Coverage:  The Linux NFS server implements all procedures except
           GETXATTRDIR in both versions of the protocol. The Linux
           NFS client implements the NFS_ACL protocol only for
           version 3; it does not implement NFS_ACL version 2.

Licensing: GPLv2

Implementation experience:  The initial Linux implementation
of the NFS_ACL protocol is described in {{Gruenbacher}}, and
subsequent modifications can be found in the Linux kernel
source code repository {{Linux}}.

{{Gruenbacher}} notes several minor differences between the
Linux and Solaris implementations of ACLs, and remarks that:
> Solaris ACLs are based on an earlier draft of POSIX 1003.1e,
> so its handling of the mask ACL entry is slightly different
> than in draft 17 for ACLs with only four ACL entries. This
> is a corner case that occurs only rarely, so the semantic
> differences may not be noticeable.

The Linux NFS_ACL implementation already builds the version 2 and
version 3 protocols from two separate source files, presently
maintained by hand.  Work is underway to generate those files from
the separate XDR descriptions in {{nfs-acl-v2-xdr}} and
{{nfs-acl-v3-xdr}} instead.

# Security Considerations

NFS_ACL was designed for a single administrative domain on
a physically protected network. This section considers a
broader environment: deployment across the global Internet,
spanning administrative boundaries, with no firewall assumed
between a client and its server.

NFS_ACL carries no security mechanism of its own. It
inherits what the RPC layer provides, and it names the users
and groups in an Access Control Entry using the identities
that layer supplies (see {{auth-and-authz}}). What follows
therefore turns on the choice of RPC authentication flavor
and transport.

Attacks on the NFS version 2 and version 3 protocols
themselves are out of scope. An attacker who can read or
alter file content directly through NFS gains nothing by
attacking the ACL that governs it, and {{RFC2623}} covers
those protocols. Attacks on the local file system that
stores an ACL, and on the mechanism by which a site maps
users to uid and gid values, are out of scope as well.

## Attacks on an Unprotected Exchange

Running NFS_ACL over AUTH_SYS on an unprotected transport
defends against none of the following.

Eavesdropping:
: A GETACL reply carries an object's full Access Control
List. An observer learns which users and groups hold access
to the object, and the uid and gid values that name them.
The list is worth reading even when the file content is not.

Modification and man-in-the-middle:
: Altering a SETACL argument changes the access control the
server installs. Altering a GETACL reply gives the client a
false view of it. Altering an ACCESS reply misleads a client
that uses the result to decide whether to attempt an
operation.

Message insertion:
: AUTH_SYS supplies no verifier by which a credential can be
validated ({{Section 14 of RFC5531}}). An attacker who can
reach the server and holds a file handle for an object can
forge a SETACL request bearing the file owner's uid.

Replay:
: SETACL is not idempotent. A replayed SETACL reinstates an
ACL that the file owner has since replaced. The duplicate
request cache ({{dup-req-cache}}) recognizes a
retransmission, but it is finite: a replay delayed beyond
its reach is processed as a new request.

Message deletion and denial of service:
: Discarding NFS_ACL messages denies a client the ability to
read or change an ACL. An attacker positioned to do this can
discard the NFS traffic alongside it, so NFS_ACL neither
adds to nor reduces the exposure.

{{Section 14 of RFC5531}} states that AUTH_SYS should not be
used for services that permit clients to modify data. SETACL
modifies the data that governs every other access to the
object. {{rpc-authentication}} reports that implementations
permit any authentication flavor on procedures other than
NULL. That records what implementations accept; it does not
recommend AUTH_SYS for SETACL.

<cref anchor="open-authsys-setacl" source="editor">
This paragraph stops short of a recommendation. The
alternative is to state that a server should refuse SETACL
under AUTH_SYS, which no surveyed implementation does. Does
the working group want a recommendation here? See repository
issue #3.
</cref>

## Protecting an Exchange

Two mechanisms available to an NFS version 2 or version 3
deployment apply unchanged to NFS_ACL, which shares the
transport and port of the NFS service it accompanies.

RPCSEC_GSS {{RFC2203}} {{RFC7861}} replaces AUTH_SYS with a
GSS-API mechanism. Its integrity service authenticates the
RPC peer and detects alteration of each call and reply,
addressing insertion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Per-request sequence numbers detect replay within a window
the server sizes. Integrity leaves ACL content readable on
the wire; the privacy service encrypts arguments and results
and closes that gap. {{RFC2623}} describes how the NFS
version 2 and version 3 protocols use RPCSEC_GSS and
Kerberos V5.

RPC-over-TLS {{RFC9289}} protects the transport connection
rather than the individual RPC message. It supplies
confidentiality and integrity for everything on the
connection and can authenticate the peer host. It does not
authenticate the RPC user, so a server relying on it alone
still takes on trust the uid and gid each request carries.

## Residual Risk

Neither mechanism changes what an authenticated caller may
do. GETACL carries no permission check of its own (see
{{auth-and-authz}}), so a caller holding a file handle can
often read the object's ACL and the user and group IDs it
names. A deployment that treats ACL membership as sensitive
cannot rely on the protocol to withhold it.

A server that maps a privileged caller to a less privileged
identity (see {{permission-issues}}) decides on the strength
of the uid the request carries. Under AUTH_SYS the client
supplies that value, so the mapping deters accident rather
than attack.

An ACL a client has read, and the result of an ACCESS
procedure, describe the server's decision at the moment it
was made. The server alone authorizes access (see
{{interpreting-acls}}) and can revoke it at any time. A
client that caches either and relies on it later may be
relying on information that no longer holds.

# IANA Considerations

In accordance with {{Section 13 of RFC5531}}, the editor
requests that IANA update the entry for the NFS ACL
service in the RPC Program Numbers registry to add
the current document as a Reference.

# Source Material

The on-the-wire protocol described here is intended to
match existing de facto implementations of NFS_ACL.

The source for the XDR specification provided in this
document is the nfs_acl.x file as found in published
versions of the OpenSolaris source code base {{OpenSolaris}},
an open source descendant of Solaris.

However, there are a few changes to the protocol as it
was originally described in the OpenSolaris source code
base.

## Redaction of NFS_ACL Version 4

Version 4 of NFS_ACL is described in the original nfs_acl.x source
file this way:

> This is a transitional interface to enable Solaris NFSv4
> clients to manipulate ACLs on Solaris servers until the
> spec is complete enough to implement this inside the
> NFSv4 protocol itself.  NFSv4 does handle extended
> attributes in-band.

Because the two non-NULL procedures in this version of the NFS_ACL
protocol were used only as part of a Solaris a prototype and there
are no other implementations of NFS_ACL version 4, it is not included
in the protocol description appearing in this document.

## Extension of NFS_ACL

Extension of this legacy protocol is out of scope for an
Informational document whose purpose is to describe existing
implementations.

## Code Compilation Requirements

The original nfs_acl.x file that appears in the OpenSolaris code
base did not compile using the widely-available rpcgen tool).

* The file does not include a definition of the ACL2_OK or
ACL3_OK constants used in definitions of result unions.

* The file does not include definitions of NFS protocol elements
that are shared with the NFS_ACL protocol, such as fhandle and
post_op_attr.

The XDR specification provided in this document rectifies those
omissions to provide a complete and compilable XDR language
description of the NFS_ACL protocol.
